Work on project. Stage 1/6: String theory

Description

Let's implement the simplest search engine possible - it should search a specific word from the line containing different words.

The first line contains several words separated by a space. The words are numbered in order, with the first word having index 1. Consider that all the words in the first line are unique, so there can be no repetitions.

Write a small program that reads a single line and then another line â€” the word to search for in the first line. The program must output the number of this word from the first line. If there is no such word in the first line, the program should print "Not Found". Remember, that indexes start from 1!

You should output exactly one line.
