Description
Ever wonder, how to estimate if the text is hard or easy to read? This is pretty easy for a human - you just read the text and feel if you struggling or not. But how to teach the computer to do that? In this project, you will write such a program.

Firstly, let's create a simple one. If the text contains more than 100 symbols (including spacebars and punctuation) then the text is considered hard to read. Else, the text is considered easy to read. If the text contains exactly 100 symbols then it is still easy to read.

The input contains a single line with text. Output "HARD" if the text is hard to read and "EASY" if the text is easy to read.


Work on project. Stage 2/4: Words and sentences

Description

But the real text can be pretty long and still can be easy to read isn't it? There need to be done another approach. How about calculating a number of words in each sentence? Clearly, if each sentence of the text contains a lot of words then this text is hard to read.

Let's suppose that if the text contains on average more than 10 words per sentence, then this text is hard to read. Otherwise, this text is easy to read. Don't worry, we will consider more scientific ways in the next stages.

The input contains a single line with text. Output "HARD" if the text is hard to read and "EASY" if the text is easy to read.

For example, the first example contains two sentences with 6 and 10 words (numbers also counts as words) so the average is 8 and this is less than 10. In the second example, there is also 2 sentences but with 6 and 16 words so the average is 11 and this is greater than 10. If the average is equal to 10 then the text is still considered easy to read.

Don't forget that the sentences can end with a dot as well as with an exclamation mark and a question mark. But the last sentence can be with or without a punctuation character at the end.


Work on project. Stage 3/4: Score!

Description
In this stage, you will program the Automated readability index. It was introduced in 1968 and a lot of research works rely on this.The index is calculated by the following formula:

score = 4.71 \times \dfrac{characters}{words} + 0.5 \times \dfrac{words}{sentences} - 21.43score=4.71× 
words
characters
​	
 +0.5× 
sentences
words
​	
 −21.43

You can look at different ages corresponding to the different scores by the table in this article.

Also, your program should read a file instead of typing a text manually. You should pass the filename through the command line arguments.

The program should output the score itself and an approximate age needed to comprehend the text.
Use rounding function to calculate the score as integer.

You should also print how many characters, words, and sentences the text has.

The number of characters is any visible symbol (so, in the real text it's everything except space, newline "\n" and tab "\t").

Notice, that the text can contain multiple lines, not just a single line like in the previous stages. You should analyze all the lines.
